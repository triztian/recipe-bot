Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta.\n\n2. In a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook until softened and translucent (about 5 minutes).\n\n3. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for another minute until fragrant.\n\n4. Add vodka to the pan and let it reduce by half (about 2-3 minutes), allowing the alcohol to cook off.\n\n5. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and black pepper, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\n6. Meanwhile, cook the penne pasta according to package directions until al dente.\n\n7. Lower the heat under the sauce and stir in the heavy cream and butter. Let it simmer for 3-4 minutes until slightly thickened.\n\n8. Add half of the Parmesan cheese to the sauce and stir until melted.\n\n9. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water. Add the pasta directly to the sauce.\n\n10. Toss everything together, adding a splash of pasta water if needed to achieve desired consistency.\n\n11. Serve hot, garnished with remaining Parmesan cheese, fresh basil leaves, and additional red pepper flakes if desired.\n\nTips:\n- Use good quality vodka as it does affect the taste\n- Don't skip the vodka - it helps release flavors in the tomatoes that are only alcohol-soluble\n- For a richer sauce, you can add more heavy cream\n- Fresh pasta works great with this sauce if available"}]}}
